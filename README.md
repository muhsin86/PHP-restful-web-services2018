This is school project work about PHP-restful-web-services and those functions which i added this project is to add courses and read courses fr√•n mysqli database.

I hidded the public database connection but if you want to check it localy you can do it by creating a database name like php-rest-api and table name like crud and in the database table insert id, course_code, course_name, course_progression and course_link.
